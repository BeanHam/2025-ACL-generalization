Short paper submission to ACL 2025

Special Theme: generalization of LLMs, from the perspective of spatial reasoning

1. why not generalizable:
- cross-task: general LLMs are not familiar with the classification task that involves spatial reasoning? (show results of LLMs in pure language understanding classification task, e.g. sentiment classification task).
- cross-domain: data shift; the pretraining data might be different from the spatial reasoning data.
